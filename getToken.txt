Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step to understand how it works:

First, we import the necessary classes and libraries required for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

Inside the main method, we define the authentication URL, username, and password.

We create an instance of CloseableHttpClient using HttpClients.createDefault(). This creates a default configuration for the HTTP client.

We create an HttpPost object and set the URL to the authentication endpoint using new HttpPost(authUrl).

We set the "Content-Type" header of the request to "application/json" using httpPost.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json"). This informs the server that we are sending JSON data in the request body.

We construct the JSON payload by concatenating the username and password variables into a JSON string: String payload = "{\"username\":\"" + username + "\", \"password\":\"" + password + "\"}".

We set the payload as the entity of the HttpPost object using httpPost.setEntity(new StringEntity(payload)). This attaches the JSON payload to the request body.

We execute the HTTP request using httpClient.execute(httpPost), which sends the request to the authentication endpoint and returns an HttpResponse object.

We retrieve the response entity using response.getEntity(). The entity represents the response content, which may include the web token.

We check the status code of the response using response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode(). If it is 200 (indicating a successful request) and the entity is not null, we can handle the response body.

We convert the response entity (if available) to a string using EntityUtils.toString(entity). This gives us the response body, which can be further processed or extracted to obtain the web token.

If there is an error during the request or the response status code is not 200, we handle the authentication error or other error conditions accordingly.

Any exceptions that occur during the process are caught in the catch block, and you can handle them appropriately (e.g., logging the error or displaying a message).
